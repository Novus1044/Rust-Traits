# Rust-Traits

As a novice programmer myself, sometimes it is hard to look at the documentation for some aspect of a language, such as Rust Traits and understand how to implement them yourself.

I hope this repository can be useful to a beginner in Rust looking for simple implementations of some of the standard Rust traits.
